# Random-Password-Generator
##This website is a random password generator that gives the user the option of a random password with a length of their choosing between 8-128 characters. The user can choose to include any combination of the following characters: Uppercase letters, Lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
The user is prompted to answer questions that will tell the program the length and type of characters the user desires. If the user selects a length that is too short, too long, or does not input any, they will be alerted and asked to choose another length. If the user denies all of the characters, they will be alerted that they must choose at least one and the prompts will begin again.
